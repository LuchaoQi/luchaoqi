### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I am thrilled and excited about exploring the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning (Natural Language Processing & Computer Vision), Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), and Algorithm Design for solving real-world problems having profound implications.  Feel free to check out my [project portfolio](https://luchaoqi.com/projects/) and [software portfolio](https://luchaoqi.com/software/).



I am the kind of person who goes sleepless when introduced to any interesting new technology, with a burning and devoted urge to pursue research in that area. Given any problem, I always try to solve it with efficiency to the most intricate levels of the problem.



Comfortable languages: R (Shiny), Python, SQL, Shell Scripting (Linux)
